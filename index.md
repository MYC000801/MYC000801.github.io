## About Me

Hi! I am a ~~first~~ second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Xuezhou Zhang](https://zhangxz1123.github.io/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://eic.hust.edu.cn/).

My research lies in the areas of Reinforcement Learning, Online Learning, Bandits and Optimization. Currently my focus is in making Interactive Decision Making process **parameter-free** and **scale-free**, and developing efficient and unified algorithms for scientific and engineering applications. 

## Research Interests

- **Online and Reinforcement Learning**
- **Algorithmic game design**
- **Optimization and Scheduling**

## News

- **[May 2024]** Our work “[Scale-free Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00930)” is accepted at COLT 2024!

- **[Aug. 2023]** Our CDC 2022 paper “[Scheduling and pricing non-preemptive electric loads: A convex approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9993199)” is selected for the Best Paper Prize by the [Energy Systems Technical Committee](https://ieeecss.org/technical-committee/energy-systems) (formerly the Smart Grid TC) of the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS).
